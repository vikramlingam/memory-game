# Memory Game - A React Component

This is a React component for a classic Memory Game. It allows users to play a matching card game and displays their statistics and win/loss state.

## Features

*   Randomly generated card pairs
*   Card flipping mechanic
*   Moves and matches tracking
*   Win condition detection
*   Reset game functionality
*   Close button

## Installation

This component assumes you have a React project already set up. To use it in your project, you'll need to import the `MemoryGame` component.

import MemoryGame from './MemoryGame';

Usage
Here's an example of how to use the MemoryGame component:

```jsx
<MemoryGame 
  onClose={() => {
    // Handle closing the game (e.g., set a state variable to hide the game)
    setIsGameOpen(false);
  }}
/>
```

You must provide a function for the onClose prop. This function will be called when the user clicks the close button on the game. A common use case is to control the visibility of the game using state.

Dependencies
This component uses the following libraries:

React
lucide-react: for icons (npm install lucide-react)
Custom components (you'll need to create these):
./memory/MemoryCard - Represents a single card
./memory/GameStats - Displays game statistics
./memory/hooks/useMemoryGame - Handles game logic
Important: You'll need to install lucide-react and ensure the custom components are correctly implemented in your project. Here's a basic structure example:

JavaScript
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export const useMemoryGame = () => {
  const [cards, setCards] = useState([]);
  // ... other state and logic
  return { cards, /* ... other returned values */ };
};
```
